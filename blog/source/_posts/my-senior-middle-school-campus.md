<b>Hi! Welcome here~</b>

My hometown is an ancient city with more than **2500** years and also known as the "<b>UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award</b>" winner in 2006 —— Yangzhou. 

But

I don't want to introduce some most popular tourist interests cuz u  guys must have acknowledged that by having recited the poem like "<b>*二十四桥*</b>明月夜，玉人何处教吹箫", where the bold italics part is located in.

Like what I say, Yangzhou is an ancient city, so many buildings and structures still keep their own styles many years ago. So, I'd like to post some pictures which were taken by me in the recent years.

	<center class = "caption">Enter from south gate, the pool will appear first</center>
</div>

In front of the building stands a tripod(but until now I still cannot get through where it comes from, or maybe.. I forgot that ?), I guess it must contain some meanings..... But that's not the point. The building, with a board saying "<b>*树人堂*</b>" is really history-worthy. It comes with the establishment of our school's predecessor, which is in <b>1902</b>. Of course many cultural treasures are maintained here, so during the three-years study, only in the first term did I get the chance to visit the inner part.

Here u can see, trees and plants are common in our campus. The two old-look buildings in pictures above is classroom buildings especially for senior III students. Surrounded with trees and plants and linked through only flagstone road, anyone can enjoy a quiet and peaceful environment here.

Feel beautiful?

Naive! In summer term, mosquitos will tell you who are masters here!!!

But to be honest, if without mosquitos, it's a extremely place for concentrating and studying.

You may notice the style of the two structures is a little special. With stone brick and wooden door, also accompanied by wood floor(but inside the classroom there are many high-tech teaching devices, don't just consider it as a completely true building~). In some regions of the city, buildings with these styles are preserved well. 

<b>So, welcome to this little ancient city for your own exploration~</b>
